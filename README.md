Eccsmith can verify if ECC is working properly on your system, by attempting to inject bitflip errors into memory and then using [Rasdaemon](https://github.com/mchehab/rasdaemon) to detect whether or not they are successfully corrected by the ECC mechanism.

Eccsmith is a modified and repurposed version of [Blacksmith](https://github.com/comsec-group/blacksmith), the program accompanying the paper _[Blacksmith: Scalable Rowhammering in the Frequency Domain](https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/blacksmith_sp22.pdf)_ (Jattke, van der Veen, Frigo, Gunter, and Razavi). Eccsmith itself is forked from [another fork of Blacksmith](https://github.com/UzL-ITS/blacksmith/tree/jsonconfig-upstream-staging) made by The University of LÃ¼beck's Institute for IT Security, which makes the program easier to use across different hardware.

Eccsmith has been verified to work on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.

**This project is stil being developed and adapted from Blacksmith! The rest of this readme is a work in progress!**

## Step 1 - Build

First, you must have g++ (version 8 or above) and cmake (version 3.14 or above) installed. Then simply run the build script, which will build Eccsmith with all of its dependencies:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

## Step 2 - Rasdaemon

Install Rasdaemon:

```bash
sudo apt install rasdaemon
```

And make it start monitoring for ECC corrections:

```bash
rasdaemon
```

## Step 3 - Hugepages

You also need to enable 1 GB hugepages on your system. To do this, edit the contents of the file `/etc/default/grub` so that the line:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```

Instead reads:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=1"
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

Then restart your system, and hugepages will be enabled.

## Step 4 - Memory mapping

Eccsmith needs to know how your computer translates from logical memory addresses to physical memory addresses in order for the rowhammer exploit to work. This is determined by the following factors:

- The memory controller your computer uses
- The memory hardware in your computer, i.e.:
	- Number of active DRAM channels
	- Number of active DIMMs
	- Number of ranks on each DIMM
	- Total number of banks, i.e. number of banks * number of ranks

Once you know what these are for your computer, you need to pick the corresponding config file from the [config directory](config/). For example, the file named `coffee-lake-1-1-2-32.json` is for computers using the Intel Coffee Lake memory controller with 1 channel, 1 DIMM, 2 ranks, and 32 banks. Once you know which config file to use, you can move on to running Eccsmith.

### Config file details

The configs are JSON files with the following format:

| Key           | Type                 | Example                                           |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | string               | `coffee-lake-1-1-2-32`                            |
| `channels`    | uint                 | 1                                                 |
| `dimms`       | uint                 | 1                                                 |
| `ranks`       | uint                 | 2                                                 |
| `total_banks` | uint                 | 32                                                |
| `row_bits`    | [uint &#124; [uint]] | [29,28,27,26,25,24,23,22,21,20,19,18]             |
| `col_bits`    | [uint &#124; [uint]] | [12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]                    |
| `bank_bits`   | [uint &#124; [uint]] | [[6, 13], [14, 18], [15, 19], [16, 20], [17, 21]] |

`row_bits`, `col_bits`, and `bank_bits` define the actual memory mapping function, which differs depending on the combination of memory controller and memory hardware being used. These three arrays represent how the bits in a logical address are used by the memory mapping function to determine which row, column, and bank make up the corresponding physical address.

The pairs in `bank_bits` mean those two bits are XORed in the memory mapping function. The same bit can appear in more than one of the three arrays, but all three must contain a total of 30 items between them, where a pair of bits within an array counts as one item. The number of items in `bank_bits` must be at least enough to distinguish between all the banks in your computer's DRAM, i.e. if there are 32 banks then there must be 5 items in `bank_bits`, because 32 can be represented by 5 bits. In seemingly all cases, `col_bits` is the bits from 12 to 0 descending, and `row_bits` is the bits from 29 descending until there are enough for all three arrays to sum to 30 items.

If the config directory doesn't contain a config file which is compatible with your computer, then you will have to create your own and reverse-engineer your computer's memory mapping function yourself, using [DRAMA](https://github.com/IAIK/drama).

## Running

Run the `eccsmith` executable located in the `build` directory. It must be run with the `-c` argument to determine which config file to use. For example:

```bash
sudo ./build/eccsmith -c config/coffee-lake-1-1-2-32.json
```

The following is a list of all suppported arguments:

```
    -h, --help
        shows this help message

==== Mandatory Parameters ==================================

    -c, --config
        path to JSON file containing the memory configuration to use. See below for sample configuration 
    
==== Execution Modes ==============================================

    -g, --generate-patterns
        generates N patterns, but does not perform hammering; used by ARM port
    -y, --replay-patterns <csv-list>
        replays patterns given as comma-separated list of pattern IDs

==== Replaying-Specific Configuration =============================

    -j, --load-json
        loads the specified JSON file generated in a previous fuzzer run, required for --replay-patterns
        
==== Fuzzing-Specific Configuration =============================

    -w, --sweeping
        sweep the best pattern over a contig. memory area after fuzzing (default: true)
    -l, --logfile
        log to specified file (default: run.log)
    -t, --runtime-limit
        number of hours to run the fuzzer before sweeping/terminating (default: 3 hours)
    -p, --probes
        number of different DRAM locations to try each pattern on (default: NUM_BANKS/4)

```

After finishing a run, you can find a `fuzz-summary.json` that contains the information from the log file in a machine-processable format. In case you passed the `--sweeping` flag, you can additionally find a `sweep-summary-*.json` file that contains the information of the sweeping pass.

## Additional Tools

### determineConflictThreshold
The `determineConflictThreshold` tool helps experimentally determine the value for `threshold`. Pass a JSON config file 
using the `--config` parameter. Set `threshold` to 0 in the JSON config file. The tool repeatedly measures access timings
between same-bank same-row addresses (low latency) and same-bank differing-row addresses (high latency) and logs those
timings to a CSV file (`--output` argument). After analysis of conflict threshold data, e.g., by using 
`tools/visualize_access_timings.py`, update the `threshold` value in the config file.

### determineActsPerRef
The `determineActsPerRef` tool helps in determining the number of row activations between two TRR refresh instructions.
It repeatedly measures the timing between two random addresses which share the same bank with different rows and logs
those timings to a CSV file. After some number of row activations, a REFRESH command will be issued by the memory controller.
This REFRESH command results in a longer access time for the subsequent row activation and can be observed by analyzing
the resulting CSV file. Since two row activations happen per measurement, the expected activations per refresh interval 
can be approximated by the average of twice the number of measurements between timing peaks. The python script in 
`tools/visualize_acts_per_ref.py` can be used to determine the correct number of activations per REFRESH interval.
The number of activations is required for fuzzing using `eccsmith`. You can pass it using the `acts_per_trefi` key in 
the config file. If `acts_per_trefi` is set to zero, `eccsmith` periodically determines the activations per refresh 
cycle while fuzzing.

### checkAddrFunction
The `checkAddrFunction` tool can be used to verify the correctness of reverse-engineered memory mapping. It measures
the average access timing between all rows on all banks for a given JSON configuration passed with the --config parameter. 
If the configuration is correct, all accesses should take at least `threshold` cycles. If the tool measures less than 
`threshold` cycles between addresses accesses, an error is logged. All measurements are logged to the output file 
specified by `--output` for further analysis.

### tools/visualize_acts_per_ref.py
The `visualize_acts_per_ref tool` enables users to visualize data collected using `determineActsPerRef`. By analyzing 
the mean distance between timing peaks in the visualization, one can determine the activations per REFRESH interval. 
It's important to note that since two address accesses are performed for each measurement, one needs to **multiply the 
observed distance by two** to obtain the correct value for `acts_per_trefi`.

### tools/visualize_access_timings.py
This tool can be used to visualize the data collected with `determineConflictThreshold`. The visualization should 
show two piles, one around the average row buffer hit timing, the other around the average row buffer miss timing. The 
conflict `threshold` can be choosen somewhere between those two piles.
